Usually, I love using [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) to quickly start a project 🚀 and focus on the website I want to build, it's an amazing tool so I don't have to worry about staffs like webpack. However, things have changed for me, now I want to dig a little deeper into frontend development and try to better understand all those utilities 🧐.

So here at Vuegular, I'll try to build a simple web application with Vuejs **from scratch**. And I hope I could finish this and benefit from it. If you are interested in how I build Vuegular step by step, check out the [commit history](https://github.com/ludanxer/vuegular/commits/master)!
