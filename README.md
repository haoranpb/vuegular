Usually, I love to use [vue-cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/) to quickly start a project and focus on the website I want to build, it's an amazing tool so I don't have to worry about staffs like webpack. However, things have changed for me, now I want to dig a little deeper into frontend development and try to better understand all those utilities.

So here at Vuegular, I'm gonna build a simple web application with Vuejs from scratch. And I hope I could finish this and benefit from it.
